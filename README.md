# sc2json

## What does this do?
sc2json is the protoypical converter for the vanilla SimCity 2000 save format (*.SC2) to the ZIP/JSON based format (SC2X) that is being developed for sc2kfix and OpenCity 2000. Development of the SC2X format is being done through this repository along with multiple internal projects, but this repository is intended to be the public-facing single source of truth for the format for now.

## How do I build it?
Building sc2json requires having wxWidgets on the build path, as the wxWidgets ZIP stream library is used for the encapsulation of the converted city data.

## That isn't helpful!
I will finish writing build instructions later.
